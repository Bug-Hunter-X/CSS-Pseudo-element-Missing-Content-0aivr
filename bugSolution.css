The solution is to always specify the `content` property for pseudo-elements, even if it's an empty string. This ensures consistent behavior.

```css
div::before {
  content: ''; /* Explicitly set content, even if empty */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```
Adding `content: '';` ensures that the pseudo-element is properly defined and rendered consistently across different browsers.
