The CSS code uses a pseudo-element, such as ::before or ::after, but does not specify content for it. This can lead to unexpected behavior or rendering issues, depending on the browser and CSS context.  Example:

```css
div::before {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```
This code snippet defines a pseudo-element but doesn't set the `content` property.  Result may be a blue box of 100x100px but the behavior may differ in different browsers.
